# Debiasing-Facial-Recognition-Systems-MIT-DL-Lab2.2
This project is a part of MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning course. In this lab, I build a facial detection model that learns the latent variables underlying face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a debiased model.
